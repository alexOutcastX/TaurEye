        {entity} (“we”, “us”) operates {product}. This policy explains what personal
        data we collect, why, and your rights under the Digital Personal Data
        Protection Act, 2023 (India).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account data</strong> — your email address and authentication
          identifiers, managed by our auth provider (Supabase).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>App data you create</strong> — watchlists, saved screens and
          report history, stored to provide the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Credit &amp; transaction records</strong> — your credit ledger and
          purchase records.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device data</strong> — push-notification tokens (if you opt in)
          and basic device/diagnostic information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment data</strong> — handled by our payment gateway (Razorpay).
          We do not store full card or bank details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use it</h2>
      <p>
        To provide and secure the Service, process credit purchases, send
        notifications you request, prevent abuse, and meet legal obligations. We do
        not sell your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Sharing &amp; processors</h2>
      <p>
        We share data with service providers strictly to run the Service: hosting
        and database/auth (Supabase), payment processing (Razorpay), and, where
        enabled, advertising (Google AdSense on the web and AdMob in the app) and
        AI inference providers for the AI features. Each processes data under its
        own terms.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Cookies &amp; local storage</h2>
      <p>
        We use local storage and similar technologies to keep you signed in and to
        store your preferences and (for guests) a local credit ledger. See our{" "}
        <Link to="/legal/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link> for a full breakdown.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed
        to provide the Service and meet legal, tax and accounting requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data,
        and may withdraw consent, by contacting <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a>.
        We will respond within the timelines required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We apply reasonable technical and organisational safeguards, including
        row-level security on user data and server-side enforcement of credit
        operations. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Children</h2>
      <p>The Service is not directed to anyone under 18.</p>

      <h2>9. Grievance contact</h2>

function Cookies() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how {product}, operated by {entity}, uses
        cookies, browser local storage, and similar technologies (together,
        “cookies”) on our website and app, and how you can control them. It should
        be read alongside our <Link to="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What these technologies are</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small files a site stores on your device. {product} is a
        client-side app, so it relies mostly on your browser’s{" "}
        <strong>local storage</strong> (not traditional cookies) to work, and some
        third-party services we use may set their own cookies. We treat all of
        these the same way in this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Categories we use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strictly necessary.</strong> Required for the Service to
          function. These keep you signed in (your authentication session, managed
          by Supabase), remember your theme and table/column preferences, and —
          for guests — hold a local credit ledger. The Service will not work
          properly without them, so they are not optional.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functional.</strong> Remember choices you make (e.g. saved
          layouts, dismissed notices) to improve your experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payments.</strong> Our payment gateway (Razorpay) may set cookies
          during checkout to process your transaction securely and prevent fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising (where enabled).</strong> When ads are turned on, we
          use <strong>Google AdSense</strong> on the web and{" "}
          <strong>Google AdMob</strong> in the mobile app. Google and its partners
          may set cookies or use your device advertising identifier to serve ads,
          limit how often you see an ad, measure performance and, only where you
          have consented, personalise ads. See{" "}
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Google’s advertising technologies page
          </a>{" "}
          for details.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party website analytics or tracking
        cookies for profiling beyond what is described above.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Browser settings.</strong> You can block or delete cookies and
          clear local storage from your browser settings. Note that blocking
          strictly-necessary storage will sign you out and may break core features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ad personalisation.</strong> You can manage personalised ads at{" "}
          <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Google Ad Settings
          </a>
          . On mobile you can reset or limit your advertising ID in your device’s
          privacy settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent.</strong> Where the law requires your consent (including
          under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023), we will ask
          before using non-essential cookies, and you may withdraw consent at any
          time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy as our services or the law change. The
        “Last updated” date above reflects the current version.

function Refund() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        This policy applies to purchases of credit packs and, where offered,
        subscriptions within {product}.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Digital goods</h2>
      <p>
        Credits and subscriptions are digital products delivered to your account
        immediately on successful payment. Once credits have been added to your
        balance, they are <strong>generally non-refundable</strong>, as the digital
        goods have been delivered.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Failed or duplicate payments</h2>
      <p>
        If you were charged but credits were not delivered, or you were charged more
        than once for the same order, we will refund the affected amount. Contact{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a> with your payment reference.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Subscription cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        Where a recurring subscription (e.g. {product} Pro) is offered, you may
        cancel at any time; cancellation stops future renewals and access continues
        until the end of the current paid period. Part-period amounts are
        non-refundable unless required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How to request a refund</h2>
      <p>
        Email <a href={`mailto:${email}`}>{email}</a> from your registered address
        with your order/payment ID and the reason. Eligible refunds are processed to
        the original payment method, typically within 5–7 business days after
        approval (gateway timelines may vary).
      </p>
